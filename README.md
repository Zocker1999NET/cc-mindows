Mindows Core and UI-System for ComputerCraft (Minecraft)

This project is for creating a operating system with a modular concept on the Mindows-Core.  
The Mindows-Core is a package of useful apis with support for different computer types and peripherals inside of Minecraft. This core is built modular for let users and developers the decision what they need and also let them the possibility to replace my own modules (for example for network operations) with their own.  
Mindows itself is a operating system using the Mindows-Core which should support sandbox multitasking and which has an easy graphical interface. Mindows should be a good system for normal users as well as for developers.
