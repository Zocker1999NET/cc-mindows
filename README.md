Mindows Core and UI-System for ComputerCraft (Minecraft)

This project is for creating a operating system with a modular concept on the Mindows-Core.  
The Mindows-Core is a package of useful apis with support for different computer types and peripherals inside of Minecraft. This core is built modular for let users and developers the decision what they need and also let them the possibility to replace my own modules (for example for network operations) with their own.  
Mindows itself is a operating system using the Mindows-Core which should support sandbox multitasking and which has an easy graphical interface. Mindows should be a good system for normal users as well as for developers.

## Project Directory Structure

The github working directory shows the whole system folder of the operating system. If the used version is runable ( = does not raise fatal errors), you should be able to copy these files and run it directly on a ComputerCraft Computer.

## Running Mindows

Anything here is written on Lua for the modification ComputerCraft by dan200 for Minecraft by Mojang. After installing Minecraft and the modification you should be able to use Mindows ingame directly.
